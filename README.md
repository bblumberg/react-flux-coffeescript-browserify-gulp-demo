React Coffescript Demo with Browserify and Gulp within existing Marionette app
==================================

## Notice
This is a proof of concept to add React to
an existing Marionette app.

## Goals
- Add a react app
- Keep Marionette/Backbone separate from the React app to keep React immutable.
  (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/reactjs/lT2pOKXUHY8)
- Only use Marionette to coordinate the switching on and off
of the react app or its own modules.
