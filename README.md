React Coffescript Demo with Browserify and Gulp within existing Marionette app
==================================

## Notice
This is a proof of concept to add React to
an existing Marionette app.

## Goals
- Add a react app
- Keep Marionette seperate from the React app
- Only use Marionette to coordinate the switching on and off
of the react app or its own modules.
